ECE243 Final Project - Undertale: Adapted Sans Fight
The project aims to adapt the fight against Sans from Undertale using four different attacks. The game is
explained below:
After pressing the space bar, the home screen loads, after which the player presses W and D to move to
the next frames showing some dialogue between the main character and Sans. When the player is ready to
play the game they press S and space and the game starts. The player needs to avoid the attacks and keep
their health up. If the health goes to zero, the game loads the game over screen, however, by pressing S
and space the user can continue the game.
The four different attacks include gravity (the user loses control of the heart as Sans is controlling it), rain
(small blocks spread over the perimeter of the square that can reduce health), block of doom (a square
tracking the movement of the heart) and a line attack (one that increases in width)
